As you\u2019ll see throughout the rest of the newsletter, it was a very busy week in Ethereum. Be sure to check out the \u2018Ecosystem Bits\u2019 section for a lot of new reading material! The two biggest events from the week were the mystery of the really large fees (which I wrote about here) and the launch of the next PryLabs eth2 phase 0 testnet - Onyx! This testnet is the successor to Topaz which ran smoothly for a few weeks and gave the team lots of juicy data/insights to work off of. For a full breakdown of the eth2 testnet action over the last few weeks, you can read the piece I wrote here. Also, Gitcoin Grants Round 6 is now live so you can donate to all of your favorite projects and it\u2019ll get match (sometimes up to 100x!). If you\u2019d like to support EthHub, our grant can be found here. Have a great week everyone! -\u00c2\u00a0Anthony News of the Week \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u00ac\u00c2\u00a0Quadriga Was a Ponzi Scheme, Ontario Securities Regulator Says QuadrigaCX operated like a Ponzi scheme. That\u2019s the key finding of an Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) report made public Thursday. OSC, one of Canada\u2019s provincial securities regulators, said the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange, which went into bankruptcy a few months after founder and CEO Gerald Cotten was reported to have died in India, \u201cwas an old-fashioned fraud wrapped in modern technology.\u201d The report, dated April 2020 but released publicly on Thursday, took aim at Cotten\u2019s practices, including allegations that he traded against his own customers, set up fake accounts on other exchanges to trade using his customers\u2019 funds and failed to maintain records. These allegations have been made in the past by Ernst and Young (EY), a court-appointed auditor tasked with recovering customer funds following the exchange\u2019s February 2019 collapse. The company has recovered about C$46 million to date. \u00e2\u009a\u0096\u00ef\u00b8\u008f\u00c2\u00a0India\u2019s Rumored Crypto Ban May Be Overblown, Say Industry Pros Rumors that India might be considering a new ban on crypto may be premature, exchange founders and startup CEOs working in the sector believe. Indian news site The Economic Times created a stir Friday by suggesting that lawmakers in India, where the Supreme Court only\u00c2\u00a0overturned\u00c2\u00a0a\u00c2\u00a0punitive banking ban\u00c2\u00a0from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) four months ago, were planning on slapping a new ban on crypto companies. The\u00c2\u00a0story, titled \u201cWith a law, India plans lasting ban on crypto,\u201d cited one unnamed \u201csenior government official\u201d who told The Economic Times that, \u201cA note [presumably on crypto] has been moved (by the finance ministry) for inter-ministerial consultations.\u201d The article doesn\u2019t provide any information on what the note could be but says that it was spurred on by the Supreme Court ruling, which allowed crypto exchanges to finally access banking services after nearly two years stuck in the wilderness. They then claim that it could well lean on a previous government draft law, from July 2019, which proposed that all forms of cryptocurrency be banned, with anyone caught holding them facing up a fine and up to 10 years imprisonment. Project Updates Introducing the Onyx Testnet PryLabs\u2019 next eth2 phase 0 testnet, Onyx, was announced this week. This testnet replaces the old Topaz one and will run the new v0.12.1 spec.
