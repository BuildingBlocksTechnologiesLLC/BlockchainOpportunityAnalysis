Sales contractors make no commissions. However, the management leaves a lot to be desired. They start projects with people that do not know how to run them. I brought them many compliance issues... one being placing inadequate information in their CRM Salesforce system that is actually used to market people that clearly was not for the persons name to be entered off the lead. When I brought this to my Manager she just looked at me along with the trainer... and said just enter it. Basically, that I should not worry about it. That it was a management issue and I am not management. Yet, she was and she disregarded the issue and I was sent to my desk to go make sales calls and place inadequate information into their sales leads funnels. Ethical issue if you ask me. Someone will one day be marketed with someone else's name to their email. This is the type management they have. On top of that, her manager also had a problem about me asking questions... since the next day after me asking her a question on an issue they were addressing in a meeting... I was released from the project. I told her I was an ethical person and will not do anything that compromises my ethics or could be a compliance issue. She got a bit defensive in the team meeting and answered the question incorrectly... trying to slide over what I was asking. She did not want to answer the question but instead tried to disregard it. I am good with their decision to end my proj...more ConsPoor Management, No one care and does not use their brain or like people who do. 3.0 Drafter | Nashville, TN | Sep 25, 2019 Used to feel like I was a part of something BIG! GBS has changed all of that, and not for the better. This review is made in reference to the new Nashville GBS Hub location only. Management at the GBS hub in Nashville is currently looking to cut costs no matter the expense to the employees. There are employees that moved from other locations within the last year that are being targeted for removal because of their salary levels and because of poor management decisions that led to over-hiring. Often times the company's mission statement gets lost in the shuffle of just trying to meet production quotas/deadlines. This is unfortunate because a lot of the innovative ideas employees have are shut down or not even recognized to begin with; this is regardless of the fact that they would presumably help the overall bottom line and/or speed-up work flow. It is my feeling that these current issues are a result of poor management of the entire GBS hub. They will pass with time and the unit will likely stabilize, but it will be at an enormous and senseless cost of many stellar individuals and opportunities where we could have handily beat out our competitors if only we focused more on our old mantra of \"Innovation and You.\" Now, that all being said, in previous years, Philips has been an excellent company to work for. I sincerely hope they reclaim that status. I would recommend working at the Nashville GBS hub if you are just getting into your career and/or you don't require the higher end of your current salary expectations. Also, if you'd like the opportunity to work at a...more ProsWork/Life balance is above par, Business Casual Dress, Great lunch room space, Good Benefits ConsArchaic year-end performance review structure, inexperienced managers making really bad choices, co-workers can hinder each others progress due to politics inflicted by upper management. 1.0 Senior Accountant | Nashville, TN | May 12, 2020 Poor Management, Unprofessional Environment I attempted to work with Philips from home during the COVID-19 situation. They shipped a ThinkPad to my home but the configuration process was a mess. Among the problems was they had me first set up software, then set up my MS profile, which is not the correct configuration sequence. After half a dozen or so phone and Skype calls to their remote tech support (somewhere in SE Asia) I asked for someone in Nashville to assist me with my software and remote connection issues. Nobody would do so. My manager claimed she had the same issues prior to the office closing due to COVID-19 and had to get a non-Philips family member to assist her in setting up her work computer. So the problem was not due to the office being closed; it was typical under normal circumstances at Philips. That told me all that I needed to know. They have been told by their auditors that they are not GAAP-compliant which is a very bad sign. I was also told their accounting department has an open floor plan with no assigned workspace, which should never happen. They will tell you that they use SAP but their system is not fully integrated and they used several systems which made accounting, particularly reconciliations, very difficult, confusing, and cumbersome. I was told after I was hired that in some cases it took up to several months for new employees to get access to all of the SAP modules that I would need (AP, AR, GL). Once again, this guesstimate was based upon a pre-COVID-19 hiring. The laptop tha...more 3.0 Assembler | Reedsville, PA | Oct 26, 2018 Its okay I liked what I did for a job. I liked the pace most times. I worked in an area with three areas and if we only have two of the three people it gets stressful. What doesn't help is when management pulls a second person to a line that has plenty of people. Leaving one of us to fill all three which is impossible. I truly dont believe the lead is professional at all. I think Skype needs monitored more. Benefits are great though. Cant beat them. But I wish they'd be more considerate on time off when it comes to bereavement. I didnt like using vacation when thats not my idea of a vacation. Also don't understand the role of the HR. Especially when her first response to any concern is \"did you call people services\". What is she even getting paid to do? We do all our paperwork for the job online. All the benefits and tests online. Her money could easily go back to the employees who fill a role that makes a difference. They are also supposed to be huge on family time. Well that's false. They were supposed to put in music in September. That is false. They were supposed to cut back overtime with now being a three shift operation. That was false too. I walked into a place with lots of false hopes. I worked at a job where I was working 11 hours a day and never saw my family. I have two small children and still never see them at this job. They took in orders they knew we couldn't meet. And instead of taking back the overtime they now require you to work every weekend but one Saturday a mont...more ProsBenefits ConsNO family time. Managment 2.0 Welder | Latham, NY | May 23, 2019 Get experience for your resume, then MOVE ON if you ever want to make a decent living salary. Philips is a great place for new welders to get experience to build their resume. You will be hired at the lowest pay they can offer, unless you have a really good amount of experience and will fight back and forth for the pay that you deserve before hire. It's very unfortunate that the Latham location is the way it is, because it has the potential to be a great place to work. The old timers there, that have been there since the beginning, make decent money because they've been there 15+ years. They would tell me \"this place isn't like it used to be\", following up with complaints about the new management (Philips took over original company) and how they're just a bunch of entitled bully's who don't understand how much time and effort can go into one work order. The managers will pay you next to nothing and will expect you to go above and beyond every day. And if you're not working over time every day and especially on the weekends.. you're trash to them. And here's the kicker.. even if you are working a crazy amount of hours and busting out orders, you still wont get a raise because they know (or think) you're not going to leave because they provide you with PPE for free and its 'clean'. Philips is extremely behind in meeting order deadlines, and continue to take more orders. You can stock up your area everyday plus some, and more than half of your products will be gone in the morning when you return. Then the managers still look at you like you're slacking trash when you're ...more ProsProvide all PPE and there's a nice view in the back smoking area. ConsLow pay w/ High expectations. There are no advancement opportunities. 3.0 Marketer | Andover, MA | Dec 10, 2018 Once a company that cared about its employees but now it's greed... Values at Philips have changed and it's because of kowtowing to Wall Street, instead of focusing on what they deliver... Quality has been lacking, just check out the FDA investigations they've had! When you say you have \"Best in Class\" and send your products out to less than quality driven countries, as well as buy supplies and other items from less than stellar companies, your quality goes down. When you're in healthcare and you try and squeeze out costs by lowering your standards on what's accepted, poor quality is the result... When you cut your older employees, simply to lower payroll, your quality and service suffers... When your management, sales, clinical and service people are leaving because of being overworked, and undervalued, it causes customer issues and sales drop... When you keep changing direction, every couple of years, because you won't and don't listen to the experienced people in the organization, especially when you don't live in the USA, but love taking every penny out of here, your products and profits are going to suffer. Look I get what this sounds like but the fact still remains, when Philips fixes these issues and they will at some point, they will be a world-class company once again. It's just tough to watch it go down the drain in the short term... They have to learn that there are ebbs and flows in every economy, and salespeople take a risk while making a living. Cutting their pay, by constantly increasing their quotas, is a bad...more 2.0 Material Handler | Bothell, WA | Apr 21, 2020 Too lean= Sweat Shop Told not to come in sick- Fired for not coming in sick A little too lean for my liking. They are getting every drop of sweat out of you every day. There is no reason you should go home with a sore back every day, unless you are being overworked. If you need time off for prearranged dentist/doctors appointments, they ding your attendance, even if you get prior approval. They don't have back up due to running as lean as they are, so someone has to pick up slack when someone is out. Mandatory OT. I can understand them wanting you there every day, but they seem to expect you to never take time off. Due to Covid-19, they told us not to come to work sick. I had a sore throat and cough, so I called out until I was well, but they fired me for absenteeism when I came back. They should have thanked me for trying not to infect others and being willing to work through the pandemic. Typical politics. To be fair, there did seem to be some nice folks working at Philips, hence the 2 star rating. I was contracting through Randstad, so I'm not sure who decided it was good policy to tell your employees not to come to work sick and then firing them for absenteeism when they call out sick. In hindsight, I should have gone to work sick. Then maybe I'd still have my job. If you get the right position/department at Philips, it may be a good place to work. If you like lots of overtime and always being at work and never taking time off for any reason, this may work out for you. You'll need good brown nosing skills to be successfull at Ph...more 1.0 Medical Biller | Framingham, MA | Nov 17, 2019 GSD Billing They fire about half of the people they hire, so I wouldn't quit a job to work there lest you find yourself unemployed. If you are already unemployed then it might be worth a try. They can be shockingly abusive to newbies, calling them names like \"stupid\". One new guy up and walked out stating that they had a \"hostile workplace.\" HR is useless and does nothing about the abuse, in fact, HR facilitates helping the abusers get revenge for anyone who dares to file a complaint for workplace bullying. In the first few months that I was there, they fired 3 new people and a fourth just up and walked out in disgust. The productivity expectations are outlandish, and you are expected to not only do your job, but to fix the mess that your predecessor left. Your work will be determined by what the older employees are looking to dump. They want to get rid of the difficult and time consuming parts of their work, while keeping the easy breezy parts for themselves. You will be stuck with a collection of whatever everybody else doesn't want because it is miserable and difficult. You will then be compared to those who have quite easy jobs because they dumped all of the most difficult jobs onto you, and found lacking. The pay is good, however, and parking is plentiful, and the coworkers are delightful. There is no backstabbing, tattling, mean girls, or throwing coworkers under a bus. ProsWonderful coworkers, free parking, good pay. ConsVerbal abuse from management, unrealistic productivity expectations 4.0 Assembler | Colorado Springs, CO | Jan 18, 2020 Great Place to work for. This place used to be nice to work for. However, when Philips bought out Spectranetics a lot of benefits for the production employees went out with it. They make overtime mandatory for weekends even if you have worked your 80 hours. Management let some employee get away with things that others cannot. Raises are a joke! with a multi million dollar company you expect your raise to be amazing but its not. There is no recognition for production. In townhall meetings office people get recognized with great awards but production gets looked over. Even though if it wasn't for production office people wouldn't have a job. Team Leads have preferences on the floor, those who are part of their \"clan\" get away with practically everything. You speak to your manager about issues in confidential and your conversation somehow gets leaked across the production floor causing hostile drama. This job is extremely easy its very repetitive I can do my job with my eyes closed as many people that have been working here for 20+ years. Health insurance is a joke! they get the cheapest premiums and then the employees are stuck with expensive medical bills. I wish production team gets the recognition and rewards we deserve! 3.0 Project Manager | Dallas, TX | Sep 9, 2019 Working for Strand Lighting was overall a good learning experience. At the beginning of my employment Strand Lighting was an enjoyable place to work, had a great team environment, and was very customer-centric. Strand Lighting was bought by Philips and for several years after was greatly misunderstood and poorly managed as the mother company did not understand what we did or the value of our work. A typical day at work included solving problems with little or no support from outside departments, no support from upper management, and for the final 6 months of my employment with them, we had no management over my department whatsoever. That was the hardest part of the job; not the workload, but the lack of support. Several top employees were let go in series of lay-offs, including myself. I will say that I learned allot about dealing with customers issues and finding ways to resolve them on my own, and when I was let go, Philips handled it well, recognized my contribution, and provided me with a severance that allowed my to start my own business. ProsGreat 401k plan, great team members in my direct department. ConsPoor Management, lack of support from other departments.
