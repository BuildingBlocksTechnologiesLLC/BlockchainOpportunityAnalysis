Request Information Start Investing In this next wave of the digital revolution, digital currencies are emerging as what many believe to be the greatest innovation since the advent of the internet. \u00c2\u00a0 For the first time in history, value can be sent anywhere in the world at the same speed as information, in a secure and trustless way. A departure from conventional economic, political, and social systems run by a handful of large centralized institutions, digital currencies are powered by millions of peers within a globally distributed network, democratizing information and value in incredible new ways. Several digital currencies, each with unique comparative advantages, may radically transform legacy systems across nations and industries around the world, driving future economic growth and becoming more valuable as the keys to our digital, global economy. At Grayscale, we believe investors deserve an established, trusted, and accountable partner that can help them navigate digital currency investing.
