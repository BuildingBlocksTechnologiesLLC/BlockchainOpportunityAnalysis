During a shift or, \"mission,\" two of us would go to white-collar businesses in Northwest Arkansas and offer a complimentary sample of red bull. \"Usually our biggest competitor is Monster but in the workplace it's coffee.\" With a solid amount of vendors doing business in Bentonville and Rogers, we had a large amount of people to win over with out product. We would do so by providing information about our product's contents and comparing ingredients with other sources of energy and caffeine. We would track consumption patterns to report mack to our manager by asking questions like \"how often do you drink Red Bull?\" Or if they say they don't like it we would just simply ask \"why?\" Our schedule was also extremely flexible. We would get \"mission assignments\" every two weeks and from the comfort of our own home we would strategically plan locations to visit in the area. A mission is usually 4-6 hours long. We also got to go on our calendar in the portal and mark our unavailability so when our supervisor (based in Memphis) went to assign each of us to certain shifts, if we are unable to work your name will not come up as an option to cover that shift. The hardest part of the job was the 7AM shifts. Our office is based in Springdale, so about 20 minutes from where I lived. So I would have to wake up at 5 am to shower, blow dry my hair, and put on makeup. Our appearance for the job was su...more Prosfree Red Bull, flexible hours, smiling faces, opportunity to travel, opportunity to grow Conshard to take up all of the time during a shift 4.0 Account Manager | Neenah, WI | Mar 5, 2019 Fun, fast-paced environment to work I have enjoyed my time at Red Bull! A typical day for me involves a morning meeting with the team to go over programs and sales objectives deemed important towards our bottom line, counting and then distributing product to a routed client base, and using sales techniques to convince customers to give Red Bull a larger presence in-store. Management at all levels go out of their way to help you, or point you in the right direction of help. It was a shock to see higher-ups at the company coming out into the field with our reps, but they make it a point! This contributes to an overall stellar workplace culture. The hardest part of the job by far is dealing with rejection. As with any sales job, you will hear no far more often than yes at first. Being able to deal with that and work through it is a must. Also, if physical labor is not your thing, look elsewhere. Although not grueling by any means, there is a lot of moving around on the job. You will be driving, walking, and pushing and pulling product despite the weather. On the flipside, the most enojoyable part of this job is finally hearing a customer say yes to a sales pitch. Also, the benefits are top notch. I will say that the pay fluctuates due to the ever changing landscape of sale which can suck, but if you hit your goals you can make a decent amount per year. Overall, this is a good place to look if you are looking for an entry level sales position with a reputable company. 5.0 Merchandiser | Orlando, FL | Mar 12, 2019 Great Company, with room to grow. A typical day at work included scheduling your route, and managing your time efficiently in order to service all stores requiring a visit on each given day. Firstly, waking up at home, and being able to drive directly to your first account, without being required to check in at an office is something not many get to experience. This provides flexibility and freedom to you as an employee, however they WILL know if you try to take advantage of the system. Very enjoyable given that everybody loves a job that allows you freedom of not being stuck in a cubicle all day, and this job did exactly that, helping time pass quicker. The management is great, and there's definitely a sense of teamwork, however the Full Time ASM's and the Part Time Merchandisers should be required to work closer together in an effort to improve all aspects of each account they service. The most difficult part of the job would be ensuring there is enough stock of the proper SKUs in each account, given that as a Part Time Merchandiser, you are in the stores the most, however are not the one creating the orders. Prosnot stuck in an office, choose your own lunch time Conspart-time low hours, must use personal vehicle 4.0 Account Manager | Concord, CA | Feb 22, 2019 Professional work enviornment with driven individuals - Typical day at work includes daily checks of inventory before leaving the warehouse, servicing and providing excellent customer service to 12+ accounts per day. - I learned how to perform schematic resets, replace out dated equipment, use the sales program encompass on work issued phones, sell-in temporary displays to increase awareness of temporary promotions. - The district sales managers provide excellent information to ensure we have all the tools necessary to be successful. - The work environment makes you feel apart of a family who all work together to achieve the same goal by encouraging personal growth and to lead by example. - The hardest part of the job is selling in on-floor displays with customers who experience high theft issues in their stores. - The most enjoyable part of the job is building rapport with my customers making them feel happy when I walk in the door knowing I'm there not only to help grow their business but build a friendship. ProsFun work enviornment with great team members Conswork uniforms rip easily and take some time to order replacements 5.0 Sales Lead | Chicago, IL | Sep 1, 2018 unique and exciting work environment, learning and meeting new people on a daily basis, learn great communication and public speaking skills. A typical day at work for Red Bull changes everyday. We go everywhere: college campuses, gyms, workplaces, music and sporting events, you name it. We communicate and learn new things about the brand and consumers everyday. I learned great communication, public speaking expertise, advertising and marketing insights and data input. The workplace culture is very unique and laid back. The brand is extremely versatile and constantly changing. The hardest part of the job is planning and executing new places to go to insure new consumer interactions. The most enjoyable part of the job is absolutely everything! ProsNew and exciting atmosphere, being able to attend cool events (Lollapalooza, Spring Awakening, concerts and sporting events) and being apart of such an amazing brand. ConsUnreliable schedule and poor management. 1.0 Account Manager | Pennsylvania | Oct 11, 2018 Fun. For about 2 days It\u2019s hard to tell where management ends and the \u201cfavorite\u201d employees begin. If there are any black people that work there, let me know. We never had one. The entire building is clique-ie, both in and out of house. Very petty. Management would nit pick about everything, and would feel the need to text you pictures along with threatening and bullying texts. The sales goals were extremely obnoxious. Dump, dump, dump product to get numbers... but don\u2019t worry, all that out of code product is your problem too. Oh, then feel free to sell your soul to the devil for a lousy $300. It\u2019s never enough no matter what you do and they will ALWAYS find something wrong. 3 weekly meetings a week. Yes 3. In a 5 day work week. The ONLY good thing about the job is weekends off (until they text you all weekend) and free Red Bull in the morning. Expired of course. Unless you\u2019re desperate... skip this one. There is a reason turnover is so high ProsWeekends off ConsEverything else 2.0 Team Member | California | Jan 20, 2019 Poor pay, poor management This company has so much money to be paying their employees more, but they will abuse their power for 12.00 an hour. A lot goes into one shift, planning, etc. because managers are never around. They are too busy off doing who knows what, but they don't even know what's going on. That's just a known thing too. I had a manager and he didn't even know the warehouse code. He didn't know how to order ice. I'm not sure how he got the position since he's never been a wings team member, yet he beat out many other people for this position. It's all about who you know in this company. A lot of under qualified people in positions. The company is just all over the place. Nobody really knows what they're doing. It's a mess. If you want a job that's all about drama, drama, drama this is the place for you. Don't waste your time here it will effect your college education. A requirement is to be in school, but they aren't understanding about school hours at all. 1.0 Sales Trainee | Taunton, MA | Oct 24, 2019 Not a good company to work for You'll start your day counting the product in your truck. At 5 am and out if 3 days out the week you'll have a meeting that last minutes. Then you go about your day hitting 15-20 stops a day that include big stores like Walmart's and targets, that you'll spend about an hour in, to gas stations and liquor stores dropping off between 10-30 cases on a hand truck up ramps and even stairs. Then you deal with waiting to get people to scan your your product in which can sometimes be frustrating due to companies having different methods to their madness. After that you'll be filling their shelfs and coolers up breaking your back just to make the customer happy. If you dont, then they will call your district manager and complain because those are the services they provided to these accounts. So all in all your doing sales/delivery driver/account manager/merchandiser/ and marketer for $45k a year and 12 hour days 1.0 Account Manager | Fort Myers, FL | Nov 28, 2019 Terrible place to work Typical day you walk in at 5:30 count your truck then sit in a 30-60 minute meeting about the same exact thing almost every single day. I will say I've learned a good amount about selling as well as the brand but that's about it. Management is absolutely terrible. Always having guys stay back at the warehouse for petty nonsense. In our job getting on the road as soon as possible is crucial but they ALWAYS hold us back for nonsense. The company culture is pretty cool but also kinda fake. They promote one thing then no actually executes it. Hardest part of the job is having to deal with managers. They pay us trash and expect us to stay out for 14 plus hours a day in a truck for 40 grand a year. The one perk of the job is good insurance and free red bull. Overall i think this place could become a great place to work for if the company didn't treat like trash and actually paid a good wage. 4.0 Brand Manager | Atlanta, GA | May 6, 2020 Fun place to work with stellar people, insane amounts of red tape You can and will learn a lot working here. The people are incredibly talented and fun to be around. Hours are flexible in terms of start and end time depending on your manager and you can work from home whenever you need to. The most frustrating thing is the red tape and amount of control the Austrians have over a market that they don't seem to truly understand. They neglect important insights in lieu of trusting a misguided heritage and gut. Innovative marketing has gone down the drain. Advancement opportunities are few and far between. There are people who have been stuck in lower to middle tier jobs for years and year with no advancement. Benefits are incredible and work perks are even better. Get paid okay, but they definitely expect employees to expect less pay since they get so many perks.
