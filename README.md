# BlockchainOpportunityAnalysis

As a service to the emergent Blockchain technology community, and in an effort to aid in the growth of that community, this project seeks to achieve the following:
* Provide an interactive visualization of the blockchain space for concretely summarizing skills, locations, verticals, salaries, opportunities and other related meta data.
* Present the interactive visualization publicly in a format that can be explored by technologists seeking to enter or expand their presence in the space.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Prerequisites
### Libraries
* GeoText
* nltk
* StanfordCoreNLP


### Programs

NLP.py - Currently runs on all of the gzipped data and outputs JSONs of predicted NER
NLP_acc.py - Takes in JSON with labeled data and Outputs JSON with predicted data. Also prints out accuracy of the NER
sample_jobs.py - Samples a specific number of jobs from available postings

#### Note for using NLP.py and NLP_acc.py

Currently the paths used in the programs are specific to my computer, I will change them to be an input during this sprint.
