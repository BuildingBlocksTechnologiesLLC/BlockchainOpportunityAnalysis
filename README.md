# BlockchainOpportunityAnalysis

As a service to the emergent Blockchain technology community, and in an effort to aid in the growth of that community, this project seeks to achieve the following:
* Provide an interactive visualization of the blockchain space for concretely summarizing skills, locations, verticals, salaries, opportunities and other related meta data.
* Present the interactive visualization publicly in a format that can be explored by technologists seeking to enter or expand their presence in the space.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

libraries to install:
* GeoText
* nltk
* StanfordCoreNLP

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Programs

NLP.py - Currently runs on all of the gzipped data and outputs JSONs of predicted NER
NLP_acc.py - Takes in JSON with labeled data and Outputs JSON with predicted data. Also prints out accuracy of the NER
